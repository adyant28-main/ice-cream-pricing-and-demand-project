🍨 Ice Cream Pricing & Demand Analytics
Excel · VBA · MySQL · Power BI

    End-to-end analytics project: From messy raw data to strategic pricing recommendations. Complete workflow across Excel (with VBA), SQL (8-step pipeline), and Power BI (interactive dashboard).

📌 The Business Problem

A street ice cream vendor operating across 3 Delhi locations had 2 years of sales data sitting in a spreadsheet — unclean, unanalysed, and underused. Prices hadn't been reviewed against the market. There was no visibility into:

    Which flavours were actually profitable

    Which seasons drove demand

    Whether the pricing strategy made sense

This project answers four questions a business owner would actually ask:

    What sold, where, and when? — Demand patterns by flavour, season, location, day type

    Are we making enough margin? — Cost structure and profitability per flavour

    How do our prices compare to the market? — Competitor benchmarking and pricing strategy

    What happens to profit if we adjust prices? — Scenario modelling and what-if analysis

📊 Dataset
Property	Detail
Period	April 2022 — December 2023
Records	148 transactions
Flavours	Mango, Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Kesar Pista
Locations	Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh
Seasons	Summer, Monsoon, Winter
Fields	Date, Flavour, Location, Season, Day Type, Units Sold, Selling Price, Cost/Unit, Weather, Festival Day

    Note: Two versions of raw data exist intentionally — one for Excel cleaning (within the workbook) and one as a deliberately messy .csv for the SQL cleaning pipeline. Both trace back to the same source; the messiness in the CSV (case inconsistencies, nulls, whitespace, negative units) was introduced to demonstrate SQL data wrangling skills.

📊 Excel Workbook — Sheet by Sheet

The workbook follows a deliberate analyst workflow. Each sheet builds on the last.
Sheet	Purpose
Raw_Data	Original untouched data as imported. Preserved for audit trail.
Cleaning_Log	Documents every error found and fix applied: wrong case (PROPER function), null costs (AVERAGEIF imputation), duplicate rows, formatting inconsistencies.
Cleaned_Data	Standardised table with computed columns: Revenue (Units × Price), Total Cost (Units × Cost), Profit (Revenue − Cost), Year. Single source of truth.
1) Pivot_DemandAnalysis	Five pivot tables covering demand by flavour, location, season, day type, and full flavour-season interaction matrix.
2) Cost Structure	Flavour-level cost breakdown: average selling price, average cost per unit, gross margin, and margin %.
3) Pricing_Strategy	Benchmarks our prices against local market. Every flavour priced below market.
4) Demand Forecasting	Projects 2024 demand by flavour using historical seasonal patterns.
5) Profit & Loss	Full 2023 P&L with units, revenue, cost, gross profit, and margin % per flavour.
Season Pricing Dynamics	Strategic centrepiece. Models 3 pricing scenarios for 2024 Monsoon using forecasted demand.
DASHBOARD	Single-page Excel dashboard with KPI cards, charts, and VBA-powered refresh button.
🔧 VBA Macros

Two macros in the workbook, assigned to dashboard buttons:
1. RefreshDashboard

Refreshes all pivot tables across the workbook in one click, recalculates derived fields.
vba

Sub RefreshDashboard()
    Dim pt As PivotTable
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each pt In ws.PivotTables
            pt.RefreshTable
        Next pt
    Next ws
    ThisWorkbook.RefreshAll
    MsgBox "Dashboard refreshed successfully!"
End Sub

2. ExportPDFReport

Exports the dashboard sheet as a formatted PDF with timestamp in filename — one-click reporting.
vba

Sub ExportPDFReport()
    Dim fileName As String
    fileName = "IceCream_Report_" & Format(Now(), "YYYYMMDD_hhmmss") & ".pdf"
    Sheets("DASHBOARD").ExportAsFixedFormat _
        Type:=xlTypePDF, _
        Filename:=ThisWorkbook.Path & "\" & fileName, _
        Quality:=xlQualityStandard
    MsgBox "Report saved: " & fileName
End Sub

🗄️ SQL Pipeline — 8 Steps
Step	Description	Key Techniques
1	Database & Table Creation	DDL, schema design
2	Data Discovery	NULL checks, negative values, distinct values audit
3	Data Cleaning	CTEs, COALESCE, NULLIF, STR_TO_DATE, ROW_NUMBER() deduplication
4	Business Summary	Aggregations, 2023 performance
5	Flavour Demand Segmentation	NTILE(4) window function
6	Advanced Analytics	Competitor JOIN, price band analysis, price sensitivity proxy
7	Month-on-Month Trend	LAG() window function, MoM growth %
8	Final Pricing Decision	CTE + RANK() + multi-condition CASE WHEN with margin priority
Sample: Final Pricing Decision Logic
sql

CASE 
    WHEN (avg_price - avg_cost) / avg_price < 0.25
        THEN 'INCREASE PRICE (LOW MARGIN)'
    WHEN total_units > 1000 AND avg_price < Competitor_Avg_Price
        THEN 'INCREASE PRICE'
    WHEN total_units BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 
         AND avg_price < Competitor_Avg_Price * 0.95
        THEN 'INCREASE PRICE'
    WHEN total_units < 500 AND avg_price > Competitor_Avg_Price
        THEN 'REDUCE PRICE'
    ELSE 'MAINTAIN PRICE'
END AS pricing_decision

💡 Key Findings
Demand Insights
Metric	2023 Value
Total Units	5,221
Total Revenue	₹2,12,044
Total Profit	₹1,20,558
Blended Margin	56.8%

    Mango is the top flavour — 1,855 units, 35% of total demand

    Summer drives 55% of annual sales

    Weekends generate 58% of revenue (27% higher than weekdays)

    Connaught Place accounts for 58.6% of total revenue

Pricing Insights
Flavour	Our Price	Competitor Avg	Gap	Margin %
Mango	₹37.43	₹45.00	-₹7.57	56.1%
Chocolate	₹41.56	₹44.00	-₹2.44	55.6%
Vanilla	₹28.44	₹35.00	-₹6.56	52.7%
Strawberry	₹34.73	₹39.00	-₹4.27	55.6%
Kesar Pista	₹57.89	₹60.00	-₹2.11	61.2%

Every flavour is priced below the local market competitor with healthy margins (52–61%), confirming room to raise prices.
Scenario Analysis (2024 Monsoon)
Scenario	Projected Profit	vs Baseline
Premium (+10–15% price)	₹28,593	+11.3%
Baseline (current prices)	₹25,698	—
Volume Boost (price cut)	₹23,132	-10.0%

Conclusion: Raising prices outperforms cutting them. Volume alone does not compensate for margin loss.
